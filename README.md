Idea for the Project
The Idea of the project is to provide current, correct information about corona-virus and if during emergency provide the generate emergency and show the nearby hospitals where the treatment can be done 
How I built it
The Application is build on Android Studio from Google Developers for the Phones Having Android above 6.0
Designing Of the Application 

•	Stage 1 –  Intro Page for Loading the Application
The project is initializing all the api and checking whether the application, API running correctly or not  

•	Stage 2 – Login Page 
The Project evolves day to  day notification hence you can enter through the google/sign-in method  the signing in method does not uses any of your details further in the app
API used – Google Sign-In Api

Stage 3 – Main Layout Of The App Consisting of all the methods/functions that can be performed in the application consisting of
a.	Virus Information

b.	World News

c.	Generate Emergency

d.	Other Information 
 
i.	Virus Information 

The Live Virus Information , also how’s it spread , total  number of people got infected ,what is the ground zero for this virus all the information are provided under that context 

ii.	World News

 Live Updating of total number of people got infected from all over the world from the deadly corovirus(Covid19) . 


iii.	Generating The Emergency

 Getting your current location and then providing the nearby hospitals present b/w you 
also generating the traffic view so you can judge the total number of location where infection can be spread with more speed 
Also by analyzing the traffic the places prone to virus are indicated by red and others by green or yellow to identify the less prone to virus 


iv.	More Information
More information consist of a video in which an analysis is made which depects how the coronavirus spread can be stopped and cut down to zero using various methods


What I learned

During my project, I learned about the corona virus (covid19) what could be the best steps to eradicate the disease also worked on major 2 API's on Google i.e. Google places and Google maps, API

What's next for Covid19

An extra feature, which will determine whether you are infected by the virus or not, also total number of hospitals which are having fewer patients for corona virus so that the user gets less probability of getting infected
